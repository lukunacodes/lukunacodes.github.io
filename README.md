<h1>An Among Us Story</h1>
<h2>Introduction
</h2>
<h3>Red was always chosen to be Imposter. But when he doesn't get picked, chaos starts. Will people believe he isn't sus? Find out!</h3>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<h3>Lime hosted the game. Red, Orange, Purple, and Lime were there. Pink just arrived. Red and Pink were siblings in real life. Red and Purple sat in a corner. <br>
    Red: Are we sus again? <br>
    Red and Purple were likely Imposter. They get picked all the time. They didn't know it would change. <br>
    Pink: Hey bro! <br>
    Red: Oh, hey. <br>
    Pink sat between Purple and Red. They watched Black, White, Dark Blue, and Yellow join. <br>
    Lime: Okay, let's start. <br>
    Red watched as the Crewmate sign go by. <br>
    Red: Uhh, Purple, are you sus? <br>
    Purple: No, how about you? <br>
    Red: No. <br>
    Purple: Guess we're crewmates, huh?

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<h3>Red: Who's sus here? <br>
    Red and Purple were in Security. They both spotted Pink, Dark Blue and Lime pass by MedBay in the cameras. <br>
    Purple: Your sister did Weapons. I saw her.<br>
    Red: So Erica is safe. Who else? <br>
    Then comms were sabotaged. <br>
    Red: You stay here. Tell me if you die. <br>
    Purple nodded, and Red ran to Communications. Pink ran beside him. Black was behind him. They ran and went in a stack. Suddenly Orange died. Red was at the door when the killing happened. He hates stacks. Lime spotted him at the door the whole time. Then Pink reported. 
</h3>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<h3>Lime: Red is safe. He was at the door the whole time. We all know he hates stacks. <br>
    Red: Pink and Purple are safe as well. Purple was at Security and Pink did Weapons.<br>
    Dark Blue: The Imposters have become the Crewmates. I'll keep an eye on Red. If I die, you know who it is. <br>
    Lime: DB, did you not hear me? Red was not near the kill! <br> Lime was protective of Red. <br>
    Purple: Uh, I am sus of DB. <br>
    Then Purple voted. Everyone then voted. DB had the most votes. He got ejected. He wasn't an Imposter.
</h3>
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<h3>Purple: Shoot. I was wrong? <br>
Red: There are two Imposters. White could be sus. No one knows. It was a stack. <br>
    Purple went to O2. Red went to Admin to swipe card. Then he heard a vent open nearby. He went to investigate. The sound came from Cafeteria. He found Pink dead. He reported it. <br>
        Lime: I'm sorry Red. But how did you find the body so quick. You're the other imposter. <br>
        Purple: No, he isn't Imposter.. Umm, because.. I'm an Imposter. <br>
        Red: Please, Purple. <br>
        Black: It can't be Purple or Red. Red did a scan, and Purple watched and didn't kill. Both Crewmates. <br>
        Red: I told you we had to do it in front of Black. Thank you. <br>
        Black: No problem. <br> Black had a huge crush on Red. Red would never kill her. <br>
        Black: But White isn't talking. <br>
        White: Oh, I was just listening on. <br>
        White voted. Everyone voted. Skip. 
    </h3>
    <h2> Chapter 5</h2>
    <h3>Red: I think Lime's safe. He saw me at the door in Comms. <br> Purple: Black sounds safe as well. We haven't had proof Lime and White are Crewmates.<br> Then the Reactor had a meltdown. Red was in Security and ran to Reactor. Purple stayed in Cafe. Red fixed it. Suddenly, a report came in. Black had just died.</h3>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    <h3>Yellow: Umm, Red is safe 'cause he would never kill Black. He know she has a crush on him. I was just doing tasks in O2 when it happened. <br>
        Purple: Then it's White or Lime!<br>
        Lime: Stop making accusations! We lost DB because of you! <br> Red: Lime! You made Purple upset! <br>
        Purple: It's fine. <br> Purple said it weakly.
        Everyone voted. Purple voted skip. Purple had most votes. Red voted Lime though. Purple was ejected. She was an Imposter. <br>
        Red: S-She betrayed me. <br>
        Lime: We all believed her. Why did you think she made DB leave? She's sus. But the big question is.. who is the other Imposter?
    </h3>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    <h3>Red and Lime walked together to O2. It was Red's final task. While Red did O2, he felt a knife through his chest. Lime was gone. It was Yellow. <br>
        Red: W-Why? <br>
        Yellow: I have to do my job.<br>
        Red died on the spot. <br>
        Yellow then self-reported. <br>
        Lime: What happened? I just left Red to do his tasks and now he's dead?<br>
        Yellow: I was going to O2 to do my tasks and I- <br>
        But then he was interuppted by White. <br>
        White: I'm sorry, you should you came there to do your tasks? Like your same excuse when Black died? You finished all your tasks in O2. Or did you kill Red? <br>
        White was a good detective. <br>
        Lime and White voted Yellow and he got ejected. In the dead chat, Pink was celebrating. Red felt betrayed. He smiled a little when Yellow's secret was revealed. Victory for the crewmates!
